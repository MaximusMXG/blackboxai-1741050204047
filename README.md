## Technical Implementation

### Slice Allocation System
The slice allocation system uses a subscription model where users have a certain number of "slices" they can allocate to videos. This is visualized as a pizza, with each slice representing a portion of the user's subscription.

### Pizza Avatar
The pizza avatar component dynamically renders a pizza where each slice represents an available slice the user can allocate. The number of slices is determined by the user's subscription level.

### Brand System
Brands represent content creators on the platform. They have profiles, can upload videos, and receive slice allocations from users. Verified brands have access to the brand dashboard with analytics and content management tools.
